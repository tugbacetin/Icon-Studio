# Icon-Studio
PNG thumbnail creator from 3D prefabs with custom or transparent backgroung using UNITY3D
==== IconStudio v.0.1 Created with Unity 2019.2.3f1 =====

It pulls your asset objects from a single file and adds a solid colour,
background of your choice, or transparent background to their background.

You can use both the buttons on the interface and the keyboard shortcuts written next to them.

!!! Make sure that your /Resources/Prefabs file is not empty.

!!!!While using the scene, make sure that the resolution of your game window is !!!1600x900!!!.
You can get 512x512 icons in this resolution.

!!!You should update the startX, startY, width, height values in IconGenerator at different resolutions. (546, 196, 512, 512)

!!! For the perfect result in the transparent background, you must select a colour that is not present
on the object from the RGB section on the screen.

The IconStudio aims to create a stylish image of objects without the need for a third-party application to create icons.

You can also update the transform settings of the object in the interface. 
!!! Be sure to press the Update button or Tab after changes.

!!! If the size of the object becomes obstructing the interface, press the R key or
move the currentObject blank object in the studio further away from the camera.

To understand its usage, you can watch the tutorial videos in the asset store 
or mail to the address below if you want to contact us.
